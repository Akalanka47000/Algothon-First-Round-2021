When talking about DNA and how people inherit different traits, you’ll probably come across the term recombination—a critical process in human genetics that ultimately helps give you a diverse genome with bits of DNA from both your ancient and recent ancestors. Understanding recombination will help you learn about human inheritance, and discover some of the processes that helped make you uniquely you.

Human DNA is 99.9% identical from person to person. Although 0.1% difference doesn’t sound like a lot, it actually represents millions of different locations within the genome where variation can occur, equating to a breathtakingly large number of potentially unique DNA sequence.

Dr. Manhattan is a famous researcher who found a way to duplicate a DNA sequence 100% accurately and build a new life with mixing different DNA sequences. Your task is to find how many unique DNA sequences in the new life. You will be given a sequence of characters and each character represents a DNA sequence.
